# Chameleon-Vision

Chameleon Vision is free open-source software for FRC teams to use for vision proccesing on their robots.

## Getting started

See Deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.  
(Coming soon!)  

### Prerequisites
---
#### For the co-processor

- Java 12 Runtime (See Deployment - Software)
- Avahi Daemon

#### For the driver station

- Bonjour


## Deployment
Deploying is as simple as uploading the chameleon-vision-1.xx.jar file to your target device.  
Run the program with `java -jar chameleon-vision-1.xx.jar`

## Software

### Java 12 
Follow the correct instructions for your platform from [BellSoft](https://bell-sw.com/pages/liberica_install_guide-12.0.2/)

### Avahi Daemon (Linux systems)
`sudo apt-get install avahi-daemon avahi-discover avahi-utils libnss-mdns mdns-scan`

### Bonjour (Windows Systems)
Download and install Bonjour [from here](https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999?locale=en_US)

## Hardware

### ARM Co-processors
Currently only Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 models with at least 1GB of RAM are tested and supported.  
Additional ARM-based single board computers (Odroid, Nvidia Jetson, etc.) will be supported in the near future.


### x86 Computers
Currently any 64-Bit devices (Windows, Linux and Mac OS) are supported.  
32 Bit devices are not supported.
