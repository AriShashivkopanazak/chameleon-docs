Before the 3d features are enabled, the camera must be calibrated. Do this from the Cameras tab, as illustrated `in this informational video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCnwO6idKq4>`_, using the provided chessboard image printed using your printer's "fit to page" mode and a pair of calipers or a ruler. This must be done per resolution that solvePNP is to be used with.

Now point your camera at a 2020 FRC vision target, enabled 3d from the 3d tab, and get started tracking! It really is Just That Easy.
