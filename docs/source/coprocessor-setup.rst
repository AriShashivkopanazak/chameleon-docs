Raspberry Pi

Software Install
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Follow the instructions `here <https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/>`_ on getting Raspbian on your SD card.
You may install the Desktop version, but for optimal performance we recommend Raspbian Buster Lite.

Ensure your Raspberry Pi is connected to a network with internet access via the Ethernet connection.
