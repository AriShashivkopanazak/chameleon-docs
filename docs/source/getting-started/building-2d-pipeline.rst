Building a 2D pipeline
======================

After reading :ref:`getting familiar with the UI<learn-ui>` you can create your pipeline
We will go over all the :ref:`vision tabs<learn-vision-ui>` one by one

Step 1: Input
----------
If you put a green L.E.D ring around the camera, any retro reflector targets will appear very bright and saturated, sometimes even completely out of the camera's scope of brightness and it will just appear as white. Also there are many disturbances in the field like scoreboards, flashes, screens, light sources and so much more that you cant account for. By lowering the exposure of the camera the sensor will receive less light from the disturbances so they will be easier to ignore and the vision target will be in the camera's scope of brightness so it will be much easier to filter out the rest of the image.

.. note::
	Some USB cameras / USB cameras' drivers cannot change exposure

| TL;DR
| Its a good idea to keep your brightness and exposure low
